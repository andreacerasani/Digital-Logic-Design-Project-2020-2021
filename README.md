# Digital Logic Design Project - A.Y. 2020-2021
My submission for the 2020-2021 Digital Logic Design Project at Politecnico di Milano.

The project consists in the HDL design and FPGA synthesis of a simplified version of the histogram equalization algorithm of an image.
The module performs the equalization of 256-level grayscale images with a maximum size of 128x128 pixels, increasing their contrast.

Vivado Webpack 2020.2 was used for the project.
